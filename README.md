**Purpose of Analysis:**  
As of January 22, only four teams remain in the NFL playoffs: the Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions,  Kansas City Chiefs, and San Francisco 49ers. As we've seen in the Wild Card and Divisional rounds, having a solid defense can make the difference between being a winning team in the regular season and an actual Super Bowl contender. For this and next week's project, we will delve deep into the 2022 season data to understand the defensive style for the final four and uncover insights into their players' performance. 

We hope that this analysis will provide fans and data scientists alike insights that could provide further appreciation for the defensive styles of these teams, as well as an understanding of which defensive unit will be most likely to reign supreme come the big game in Las Vegas.


## This project will:

- Use Numpy & Pandas packages to take a look into the basics of our data tables and assess tackle efficiency.
- Evaluate the Ravens, Lions, Chiefs and 49ers on their tackling proficiency and win rate.
- Look into the tackling performance for the four teams in the 4th quarter to see how these teams adapt to different schemes and in the clutch.
